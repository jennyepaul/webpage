        About me: I started my higher education by persuing a degree in
        Bioengineering from the University of Illinois at Chicago. During
        this I had to take a class in computer science and fell in love.
        I then left UIC to get my general education requirements completed
        at Harper College. After graduating with an Associate of Science, I
        transferred to Northern Illinois University and majored in computer
        Science with an emphasis in Software Development. During the summer
        between graduating Harper College and going to NIU, I completed a
        software development internship at ServerCentral TuringGroup. There
        I accumulated an immense amount of knowledge and broadened my skill set.
