            About me: I started my higher education by persuing a degree in
            Bioengineering from the University of Illinois at Chicago. During
            this I had to take a class in computer science and fell in love.
            I then left UIC to get my general education requirements completed
            at Harper College. After graduating with an Associate of Science, I
            transferred to Northern Illinois University and majored in computer
            Science with an emphasis in Software Development. During the summer
            between graduating Harper College and going to NIU, I completed a
            software development internship at ServerCentral TuringGroup. There
            I accumulated an immense amount of knowledge and broadened my skill set.
